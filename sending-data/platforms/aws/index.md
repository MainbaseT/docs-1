Baselime provides observability for applications deployed on AWS, with a focus on modern serverless and container serices such as AWS Lambda, Amazon ECS and AWS AppRunner.

To connect your AWS account to Baselime, log in the [Baselime console](https://console.baselime.io). Create a new environment, select "Connect AWS account" and follow the instructions. You will be prompted to deploy a CloudFormation stack onto your AWS account. The stack is [open-source](../../../connectors/aws.md) and does not have any impact on your AWS bill.
