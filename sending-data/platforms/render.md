# [Deprecated] Render

Render is a cloud platform for hosting and deploying web applications and websites. It provides a way to securely stream logs from your services deployed on Render to Baselime using the [Syslog protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syslog) over [TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security).

## Baselime integration

Baselime provides advance logging capabilities for servoces deployed on Render. You can start streaming your logs from Render in a few steps:

### Step 1. Create an environment on Baselime

Navigate to the [Baselime console](https://console.baselime.io), create and environment and select "Connect Render account".

Once the environment is created, copy the `BASELIME_API_KEY`.

### Step 2. Create the Log Stream in Render

Navigate to your [Render dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com/u/usr-0/settings), select Log Streams, and Add Log Stream.

### Step 3. Configure the Log Stream

- Set `Log Endpoint` to `syslog.baselime.io:514`
- Set `Token` to `render:BASELIME_API_KEY`
- Add the Log Stream

!!!
Replace `BASELIME_API_KEY` with the API key from the Baselime console is Step 1.
!!!

!!!
Make sure to prefix the `Token` with `render:`. This enables Baselime to adequately parse logs from Render and enable you to run complex queries on them.

### Step 4. Use your logs from Render

Once the Log Stream is created, all your logs from Render will be available in Baselime for searching, queries, dashboard and alerts. No further code changes are required in your code base.
